								I am a <b>graduate student</b> at Indiana University and a leader in the Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) survey. Together with my advisor, <a href="https://www.astro.indiana.edu/faculty/salzer.shtml" target="_blank">John Salzer</a>, and fellow graduate student, <a href="https://jsieben7.github.io/" target="_blank">Jennifer Sieben</a>, we discover and study emission line galaxies at different points in our universe's history.  
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to the SFACT survey, I am also interested in learning and applying data mining and machine learning techniques to research problems in astronomy. I have taken graduate level data mining and machine learning courses at IU and received my minor in Scientific Computing in 2016.

								I received my <b>bachelor's degree</b> in Astronomy and Physics, with a minor in Mathematics, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While at UW I constructed radiative transfer models of edge-on spiral galaxies, worked to determine the Milky Way's rotation curve, and converted old astronomy code from IDL to Python.

								My current research is focused on discovering and studying emission line galaxies through the Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) survey. Though we will discover many star-forming galaxies through the survey, I am more interested in the active galactic nuclei (AGN) that we will discover as part of the survey. I also use a spectral synthesis code called <a href="https://www.nublado.org/" target"_blank">Cloudy</a> to generate models of AGN with different metallicities and use these models as evidence for chemical evolution over time.

							<h3>Active Galaxies Across Cosmic Time</h3>
							<h4>Advisor: Dr. John Salzer</h4>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/agn.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%; height:100px; object-fit: cover;"/>
							</span>
							<h4>What are AGN?</h4>
							<p>
								Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the most luminous, persistent sources of light in the universe, often outshining their entire host galaxy and all the stars therein. The light coming from these compact objects is so bright and energetic that it cannot possibly be produced by stars. The only possible mechanism for producing so much energy in our universe is the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole located at the host galaxy's center. As it falls onto the black hole, before it passes the event horizon from which no light can escape, the material heats up through friction and produces light which we can observe.
							</p>
							<h4>What is SFACT?</h4>
							<p>
								As part of the Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) survey, my collaborators and I discover AGN at different points in our universe's history. Because it takes light time to travel across the vastness of space, when we look out into our universe we are also looking back in time. Each galaxy we discover at larger distances away from us is like looking farther back into the history of our universe. The SFACT survey is collecting a sample of AGN at different distances, allowing us to explore how these objects change over time as our universe evolves.
							</p>
							<h4>Why is this important?</h4>
							<p>
								It is important to study how galaxies change over time to better understand how galaxies form and evolve. A current theory is that larger galaxies form through the merging of smaller galaxies. This merging triggers star formation through gas collision and causes gas to fall to the centers of galaxies, producing AGN. Therefore, there are strong theoretical reasons to expect that star formation and AGN activity are linked. A lot is known about the history of star formation in our universe but little is known about the history of AGN, specifically Seyfert galaxies (i.e. galaxies whose AGN produce comparable light to their stars).
							</p>
							<h4>What will we learn from SFACT?</h4>
							<p>
								This project's goal is to explore the connection between AGN and star-forming galaxies and is part of my dissertation research to study how AGN evolve over time. With the high sensitivity of the SFACT survey, I will be able to robustly detect AGN out to large distances and can compare the density of AGN to the density of star-forming galaxies, exploring any connection between the two. The spectra gathered as part of the SFACT survey will also allow measurements of the elemental abundances of each of the AGN host galaxies and could provide evidence for chemical evolution over time. Therefore, this project will provide valuable insight into how AGN evolve over time and will reveal a piece of the mystery that is the history of our universe.
